# This module deploys 2 tools
#
# - etc-update
# - etc-downgrade
#
# They both look for config files in /etc
# which are named .rpmnew or .rpmsave
# and provide a way to merge them.
# as well it deploys some cronscripts 
# which will look for them
#
# this is tool is thought for rpm-based
# systems and to provide the same elegant
# way, like gentoo does.
# it is only tested on centos and fedora
# systems.
